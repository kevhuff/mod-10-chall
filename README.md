# Logo Generator

This is a command-line application that generates SVG logos based on user input. The application prompts the user to enter text, text color, shape type, and shape color, and then creates an SVG file named `logo.svg` that represents the generated logo. The user can view the logo by opening the `logo.svg` file in a web browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Jest (if you would like to test)

## Installation

 - Clone the repository by running the following command in your shell:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kevhuff/mod-10-chall

    cd logo-generator
    npm install

## Usage

Run the application:

 in your shell

```
node index.js
```

Follow the prompts to enter the logo text, text color, shape type, and shape color.

After providing the input, an SVG file named logo.svg will be generated in the project directory.

- Open logo.svg in a web browser to view the generated logo.
I prefer the drag and drop method. Use this bt dragging the logo.svg file into your browsers window.
